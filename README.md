🌐 Local Network Port Scanning Project Report

This repository documents a port scanning and network analysis task performed on a local network segment using Nmap and Wireshark.

🎯 Task 1: Local Network Port Scanning

This task aimed to identify active hosts and open services within a specified network range.

🛠️ Tools & Scope

Category

Details

Tools Used

Nmap, Wireshark

Network Range Scanned

10.87.88.0/24

Nmap Command

nmap -sS 10.87.88.0/24

ℹ️ The -sS flag initiates a TCP SYN Scan (or "half-open" scan), which is generally faster and stealthier than a full TCP connect scan.

📊 Scan Results Summary

The scan identified two active hosts and revealed the following services:

IP Address

Device

Open Ports

Services

10.87.88.224

Router

53

DNS

10.87.88.89

My Laptop

135, 139, 445, 5357

MSRPC, NetBIOS, SMB, WSDAPI

The complete raw scan output is available in the scan.txt file.

🦈 Wireshark Analysis

Wireshark was used to capture and analyze the network traffic generated by the Nmap SYN scan, confirming the underlying TCP handshake behavior.

1. SYN Packets (Nmap Scan Requests)

Filter Used: tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0

Purpose: This filter displays packets where the SYN flag is set but the ACK flag is not, which corresponds to Nmap sending its initial probe packets to various ports.

Visual Evidence: wireshark_syn.png

2. SYN-ACK Packets (Open Ports Responding)

Filter Used: tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 1

Purpose: These are the responses from active hosts that have an open port. The host responds by setting both the SYN and ACK flags, indicating the port is ready to establish a connection.

3. RST Packets (Closed Ports Responding)

Filter Used: tcp.flags.reset == 1

Purpose: These packets indicate that a closed port rejected the connection attempt from Nmap by sending a Reset (RST) flag.

✅ Conclusion

The port scan successfully identified two active hosts on the 10.87.88.0/24 network. The presence of key services like DNS (53) and SMB/NetBIOS (139, 445) was confirmed. Wireshark analysis validated the core mechanism of the TCP SYN Scan, clearly showing the distinct SYN, SYN-ACK, and RST packets corresponding to the probing of open and closed ports
